# Rewards Program (JavaScript Assignment)

A retailer offers a rewards program to its customers, awarding points based on purchases:

- 2 points for every dollar spent over **$100** in each transaction.
- 1 point for every dollar spent between **$50 and $100** in each transaction.

**Example:**  
A $120 purchase = 2Ã—20 + 1Ã—50 = **90 points**.

This program:
- Simulates an **asynchronous API call** to fetch transaction data.
- Calculates **monthly and total reward points** for each customer.
- Outputs a **summary report**.
